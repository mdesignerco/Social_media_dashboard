# Social_media_dashboard
 I used to develop this challenge HTML5, SASS and JavaScript

## Â¿What is the challenge?
### The challenge

Challenge is to build out this Social Media Dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Toggle color theme to their preference
